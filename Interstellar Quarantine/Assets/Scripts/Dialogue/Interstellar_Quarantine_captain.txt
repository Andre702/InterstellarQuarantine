:: Captain {"position":"550,600","size":"100,100"}
As you enter the bridge room, you find yourself face to face with probably the least competent person on this ship...
He seems busy fixing and adjusting his ridiculous outfit. When you clear your throat meaningfully, he finally notices you.

"Oh, you finally showed up. We need to get rid of the problem of this disease. You probably came for my great advice. I have been planning for such occasions for a long time and I am sure that the ship needs to be aired to get rid of these pesky viruses. We'll open a few hatches to make a draft, and if that doesn't help, we'll try to immunize the crew by giving them some bleach. After all, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?"

...

Captain seems mad. You should probably [[keep him out]] of this as long as you can.

You advise the captain to stay in the cabin while you deal with the problem. The captain nods proudly at you and looks pleased that someone will do the job for him.

Let's hope he does not get out...
