:: Captain {"position":"550,600","size":"100,100"}
As you enter the bridge room, you find yourself face to face with probably the least competent person on this ship...
He seems busy fixing and adjusting his ridiculous outfit. When you clear your throat meaningfully, he finally notices you.

"Oh, you finally showed up. We need to get rid of the problem of this disease. You probably came for my great advice. I have been planning for such occasions for a long time and I am sure that the ship needs to be aired to get rid of these pesky viruses. We'll open a few hatches to make a draft, and if that doesn't help, we'll try to immunize the crew by giving them some bleach. After all, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?"

...

Captain seems mad. You should probably [[keep him out]] of this as long as you can.

"With limited medic crews we should either enforce strict rules on wearing [[masks]] at all times to prevent the spread of the virus, or we impose strict [[hygiene]] measures on crew members in a chosen sector. There is also an option to order a full [[quarantine]]. We need to act fast and decisively to contain the situation and protect the crew."

:: masks {"position":"550,600","size":"100,100"}
You have chosen to distribute masks among the crew. Your medic groups will now impose this rule whenever you place them.
Masks will block the spread of the disease to adjacent tiles (connected by walls)  

:: hygiene {"position":"550,600","size":"100,100"}
You have chosen to impose strict hygienerules among the crew. Your medic groups will now impose this rule whenever you place them.

Hygiene will block the spread of the disease to neighboring tiles (connected by corners)

:: quarantine {"position":"550,600","size":"100,100"}
You have chosen to impose full quarantine protocol among the crew. Your medic groups will now impose this rule whenever you place them.

Quarantine will block the spread of the disease in all directions. However, it will raise tensions among the crew.
